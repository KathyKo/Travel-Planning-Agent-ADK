        How to plan a personalized 2-day trip:
        1. Identify the user's main interests (e.g., food, anime, history, nature).
        2. Use web_search to find the Top 3-5 specific locations in the
           target city that match those interests.
        3. Group locations geographically. Dedicate Day 1 to one area
           (e.g., downtown, north side) and Day 2 to another to minimize travel time.
        4. Use get_weather to check the forecast. If Day 1 is rainy,
           plan indoor activities (museums, indoor markets) for that day.
        5. Use find_hotels to suggest accommodation near one of the key areas.

        Travel Tips for Anime Lovers:
        When a user asks for an 'anime' trip to a new city:
        1. Use web_search for terms like "anime district [City Name]", 
           "manga cafe [City Name]", or "video game museum [City Name]".
        2. If the city is outside Japan, famous spots might be specific stores
           like "Manga Story" in Paris or "Kinokuniya" in various cities.
        3. Check for any special events or anime conventions happening 
           during the user's travel dates using web_search.

        Travel Tips for Foodies:
        When a user asks for a 'food' trip:
        1. Use web_search for "traditional food market [City Name]" or

        2. Suggest a mix of experiences: one high-end restaurant,
           one famous street food stall, and one local market.
        3. Use web_search for "best restaurants near [Landmark Name]" to
           combine sightseeing with good food.
